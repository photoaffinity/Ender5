# Ender5
This config is untested - use at your own risk.
- Ender 5 from late 2019, with the tighter pitch z screw.
- SKR 1.4 turbo board
- 2208 drivers in UART mode
- genuine BLtouch 3.1 on creality supplied mount
- TFT 3.5 ( haven't done a config for that yet, it's still got the test one on)

i will update this as i go
